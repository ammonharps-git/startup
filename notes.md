## Github Conflict Resolution assignment

Honestly, I found this assignment to be pretty helpful for my understanding of git and github. It was always something that people talked about but never fully explained. It doesn't seem particularly difficult and has so many practical and helpful purposes. I'm excited to continue to use Git and Github for coding assignments in this class, other classes, and in my future career.
