## Github Conflict Resolution assignment

Honestly, I found this assignment to be pretty helpful for my understanding of git and github. It was always something that people talked about but never fully explained. It doesn't seem particularly difficult and has so many practical and helpful purposes. I'm excited to continue to use Git and Github for coding assignments in this class, other classes, and in my future career.

## Setting up Amazon Web Services EC2

This is awesome. There are so many things that I didn't even know existed here, and I think it's really cool to finally see the backend of how a lot of the internet works. 

Elastic IPv4 address: 44.221.174.143

Remember to cancel the elastic IP address at the end of the semester, because it will continue to charge you even if you terminate your instance.

-[] Cancel elastic IP address
-[] Terminate instance

## Setting up Https, TLS, and web certificates

This is super cool. It also gave me a lot of technical trouble and wasn't working correctly when I ran it in Chrome. After about an hour and a half of painstaking troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem was solved by just clearing my browser cache and cookies. So sometimes it's good to remmeber that a simple reset will fix many problems!

Domain name: listentotalks.click
Useful command for caddy restart: sudo service caddy restart

Overall this assignment was very helpful for me for understanding how domain names, TLS, and web certificates work. I think it's super interesting.
