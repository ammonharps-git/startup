# CS 260 Notes

## Github Conflict Resolution assignment

Honestly, I found this assignment to be pretty helpful for my understanding of git and github. It was always something that people talked about but never fully explained. It doesn't seem particularly difficult and has so many practical and helpful purposes. I'm excited to continue to use Git and Github for coding assignments in this class, other classes, and in my future career.

## Setting up Amazon Web Services EC2

This is awesome. There are so many things that I didn't even know existed here, and I think it's really cool to finally see the backend of how a lot of the internet works. 

Elastic IPv4 address: 44.221.174.143

Remember to cancel the elastic IP address at the end of the semester, because it will continue to charge you even if you terminate your instance.

-[] Cancel elastic IP address
-[] Terminate instance

## Setting up Https, TLS, and web certificates

This is super cool. It also gave me a lot of technical trouble and wasn't working correctly when I ran it in Chrome. After about an hour and a half of painstaking troubleshooting, I discovered that the problem was solved by just clearing my browser cache and cookies. So sometimes it's good to remmeber that a simple reset will fix many problems!

Domain name: listentotalks.click
Useful command for caddy restart: sudo service caddy restart

Overall this assignment was very helpful for me for understanding how domain names, TLS, and web certificates work. I think it's super interesting. 

## Startup HTML

This project was helpful for understanding how to create the skeleton of a website. I think it is super interesting how the different pages can link between each other and create a better user interface. 

Overall this assignment was helpful for understanding how to create a more structured environment for the full website. 

# Startup CSS

CSS is super interesting and seems like the real backbone to modern web graphics. It controls a website's visual appearance, which is separate from its content. This allows for cleaner code and easier maintenance. With CSS, I can style fonts, colors, layouts, and even add animations, making your webpages visually appealing and user-friendly.

# Startup Services

Backend services are the hidden engines that power websites and apps. They handle crucial tasks like storing data in databases, managing user accounts, and sending push notifications. They prepare the data, manage requests, and ensure everything runs smoothly, while the frontend delivers the final experience to the user. I appreciate the simplicity and power of middleware for creating chains of processing requests.

# Startup Login

MongoDB is amazing! I really like that it stores data like documents, not rigid tables. That means no more fighting with schemas â€“ I can just add new info as I get it. This is perfect for projects with constantly evolving data. Plus, it uses JSON, which I already know, for super easy interaction. MongoDB sounds like a game-changer for building flexible and scalable web apps.

# Startup Websocket

WebSockets are super useful. Instead of the usual back-and-forth of refreshing pages, a browser and server can send messages directly to each other. This is perfect for live updates like chat apps or dynamic dashboards, and it allows for a whole new phlethora of interesting peer-to-peer relationships in web applications.
